Complexity – As a 2-man group, during the 3-month period, we created four games in which the user plays against the AI. We have written extensive algorithms (e.g., the Minimax and Monte Carlo Tree Search) for the AI algorithms. In particular, we have also written extensive state heuristics for the Gomoku and Connect 4 (Four in a row) AIs.


Utility – The use case of our app is clear and could be easily be used by others who are interested in these types of games.


Error-free – Our app has no runtime errors, unexpected behaviours or runtime warnings.


Consistency – As a 2-man group, our app manages to show consistency by using the same background colour for all view controllers and having the same style for all buttons. 


User experience – Our app allows users to select different games and different difficulties for each game. On the main view controller, our app also has an «info» button where it is needed that shows a help message, making it easier for users to understand what our app is about and how to use it.


User interface – In our app we have used fancy fonts and colours for view controllers, title labels and buttons. On the main view controller, when the user selects a game, a real-life picture of the game is shown, making the app more interesting.


Optimisation – We have managed to make our app performant enough for users to be able to use the AI without being frustrated with the length of the turn. For the medium or hard Gomoku game, it takes up to ca. 5-7 seconds for the AI to «think» and make a move. Otherwise (e.g., for the Tic-tac-toe game and the easy Gomoku game), the AI moves immediately in response to the player’s move.


iOS Feel – Our application feels like an iOS app and follows HIG.


Framework Usage – Our app utilises the Firebase Framework in order to store user data. This allows for users’ games and their analysis to be saved so that they are always able to access it and look at their previous games.


Swifty code – We have used the object-oriented programming diagram to represent the game states for AI analysis, with up to one class for each swift file. Our project is well-structured, e.g., we divide our swift code into groups (e.g., games, analysis) and subgroups (e.g., different games under the «game» group).
